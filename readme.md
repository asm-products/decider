## Vagrant

Experimenting with using Vagrant. To get started:

  * download Vagrant: http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
  * in this project's root directory, type `vagrant up` (can take 10 minutes when run the first time)
  
The Vagrant box is configured with the `vagrant.sh` and `vagrant_privileged.sh` scripts. 

RubyMine 6 has some Vagrant support, such as running the app and tests through RubyMine's GUI. 
It's supposedly better in RubyMine 7.
